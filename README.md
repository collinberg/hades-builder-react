# Hades Run Builder

The Hades Run Builder is designed to allow you to create a character build for for play throughs. This tool allows you to keep track of boons you've selected, and share them with others (Eventually).

Start by selecting your Weapon and Aspect. After selecting those, you can either add common boons to your boon list, or select your Ability boons from the sidebar.

# Behind the Scenes

This is a work in progress React App that I'm using to practice and build upon as I learn React. It's built off the standard React + Typescript + Vite template.

You can read more about the template on their [project page](https://vite.dev/guide/).

## TO DO

- Use Variable States for setting and updating build state.
- Allow user to name a Build
- Share Button that generates a URL for others to see your build.
- Modal for first time visitors explaining what to do
- Mobile View. It currently works on desktop but cramming this all into a mobile app might be helpful.
- Enhanced Prerequisites interface so you can tell what Boons you need.
- Add Duo Boons
- Add Legendary Boons
- Add damage descriptions
